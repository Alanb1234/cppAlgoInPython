#cppProgramsInPyhton

The aim of this project was to show how interoperation between Python and C+ can produce programmes that are way faster and more efficient then programmes written in python alone.
Interoperation is achieved by using libraries such as boost.python can be used as a bridge between Python and C++.
As an example of why interoperation is important, run times of sorting algorithms created using python alone and python and c++ will be compared. The results will be illistrated on a website.
